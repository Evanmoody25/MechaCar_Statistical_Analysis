# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview of Project

A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this challenge, you’ll help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:

* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes

* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots

* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population

* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Deliverables

* Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

* Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils

* Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

## Tools

* Sources: MechaChar_mpg.csv and Suspension_Coil.csv

* Data Tools: tidyverse, dplyr, and ggplot 2

* Software: RScript and R

# Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Requirments: 

* 1.) The MechaCar_mpg.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe

* 2.) An RScript is written for a linear regression model to be performed on all six variables

# mpg = (6.267)vehicle_length + (0.00124)vehicle_weight + (0.0688)spoiler_angle + (3.546)ground_clearance + (-3.411)AWD + (-104.0)

* 3.) An RScript is written to create the statistical summary of the linear regression model with the intended p-values

* 4.) There is a summary that addresses all three questions
